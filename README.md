# *multicastR*: A companion to the Multi-CAST collection

This package provides a basic interface for accessing annotation data from the
Multi-CAST collection, a database of spoken natural language texts edited by
Geoffrey Haig and Stefan Schnell. The collection draws from a diverse set of
languages and has been annotated across multiple levels. Annotation data is
downloaded on request from the servers of the University of Bamberg. See the 
[Multi-CAST website](https://multicast.aspra.uni-bamberg.de/) for more
information and a list of related publications.
